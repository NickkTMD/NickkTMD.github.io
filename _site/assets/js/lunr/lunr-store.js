Its key features include:     Adjustable flow rate   Compatibility with various syringe sizes   User-friendly interface   Safety mechanisms to prevent over-pressurization   Off-the-Shelf Parts Required                  Part Number       Description       Quantity       Supplier Link                       OSP-001       DC Motor with Encoder       1       Link                 OSP-002       LCD Display 16x2       1       Link                 OSP-003       Syringe Mount Bracket       1       Link                 OSP-004       Push Buttons       3       Link                 …       …       …       …           3D Printed Parts Required                  Part Name       Description       Material       Quantity                       3DP-001       Motor Mount Bracket       PLA       1                 3DP-002       Syringe Holder       PLA       1                 3DP-003       Button Enclosure       ABS       1                 …       …       …       …           Arduino Code   The Arduino code for this project can be accessed here: Syringe Pump Arduino Code.   Fusion 360 Model     Operating the Pump      Setup: Securely attach the syringe into the holder, ensuring the tip is connected to the desired delivery tubing.   Power Up: Turn on the device using the main power switch.   Flow Rate: Navigate the LCD menu using the push buttons to set the desired flow rate.   Start: Once settings are configured, press the ‘Start’ button.   Monitor: The LCD display will showcase the current status, flow rate, and any potential errors.   Shutdown: Press and hold the ‘Stop’ button to halt operations. Always ensure the device is turned off after use.
