        "title": "Bike Phone Mount",
        "excerpt":"Purpose/Features of the Design   The Bike Phone Mount allows a user to mount their phone to their bike either horizontally or vertically. This is ideal for seeing directions, but can also be used for questionable leasure.   Top-Down Modeling   Top-down modeling is a CAD technique for designing assemblies with complex interdependencies and relationships between components. Components are designed and assembled at the same time, allowing dimensions from certain parts to be used when defining other parts. This also allows for global parameters to be created in a simplistic way.   Top Down modeling was leveraged in this design to ensure the various components fit together, and also to make sure the grip fit around the handlebar, and the case fit around a phone.   The large handlebar grip component was designed first. Dimensions for the grip were determined relative to a handlebar component in the same CAD assembly file. An opening for a screw was made in the large handlebar grip.   Next, the small handlebar grip component was made relative to the large one. This made it very easy to line everything up, such as the connecting axle and a concentric hole for a screw to connect the two.   Next, a slot was added for the large handlebar grip. The phone holder was then designed, such that it could slide into the previously created slot. Top down modeling allowed the slot and connector to be made relative to eachother such that they would fit together with proper clearance.   Last, a threaded rod on the phone case was added, and the nut that would screw into it to secure the phone was designed, again with the top down approach.   Rationale Behind the Design   Many choices were made when creating this design, all of them made perfectly and with perfect information.   The choice of using a locking mechanism and a heat-set insert to connect to the handlebar allowed for a good mix of simplicity and security in the connection. The connection to the handlebar is secure, works with different sizes, and is easily reversible.   The click-and-lock mechanism between the large and small handlebar grip components adds an extra layer of convenience, allowing users to quickly connect these parts without any tools or fasteners.   The sliding mechanism was the easiest way to allow for secure attaching of the phone either vertically or horizontally. The simple yet secure nature is evidence of an incredible design.   Finally, using a threaded rod and a hexagon nut proved to be the simplest way to lock the phone in place. Adjustment is easy, but in theory simple and secure.   Assembly Instructions   Assembling the phone holder is exceptionally straightforward:   Print the Components: 3D print the STL files for the phone holder components. Ensure that the printer settings match the chosen material (discussed later).   Assembly:  a. Melt a heat set insert into the large handlebar grip component.   b. Attach the small handle bar grip component to the larger one by clicking the axel into the round slot.   c. If desired, screw the small handle bar grip component into the larger one. It can also be locked into place using the phone holder.   d. Slide the phone holder into the handle bar grip component.   e. Place the phone in the holder and lock it into place using the hexagon nut.   Material Choice   PLA (Polylactic Acid) was chosen as the material for the phone holder case for several key reasons. PLA is first and foremost easy to print - its low printing temperature and minimal warping characteristics increase the odds of a smooth printing process.   Additionally, PLA is both durable and lightweight, which are critical attributes for a bike or scooter accessory. It can withstand outdoor conditions, including exposure to sunlight and moisture, without significant degradation.   PLA was chosen mainly over ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene). In comparison to ABS, PLA offers a few properties that make it a more attractive choice. PLA is known for its ease of printing, with a lower printing temperature and minimal warping. This increase in printability makes it more user-friendly to the millions that will print this case, especially for those new to 3D printing (not me). PLA is also better for the environemnt, which I definitely knew. While ABS can emit potentially harmful fumes during printing, PLA is non-toxic and odor-free, ensuring a safer and more comfortable working environment.   PLA is also biodegradable and derived from renewable resources, while ABS is not biodegradable and thus has a larger environmental footprint. Additionally, PLA’s lightweight yet durable nature strikes a balance between strength and minimal weight, ensuring the phone holder’s robustness without adding unnecessary mass to the bike or scooter.

        "title": "Microfluidic Mixer",
        "excerpt":"Project Overview   The goal of this project was to construct a homogenous mixer microfluidic device to mix two unknown liquids. I kept asking Professor Florian why he needed so many devices to mix so many fluids, and what the fluids were, but he would just shoot me a stern look then continue on. I think he was trying to put lazy old laminar flow in its place.   Some applications of a homogenous microfluidic mixer include:     Mixing of reagents for chemical reactions   Mixing of blood samples for analysis   Mixing of fluids for drug delivery   Lab on a chip devices (think Elizabeth Holmes, we stan a queen)   Design   The project was designed based on this paper:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116190/pdf/ijms-12-03263.pdf as well as research through ChatGPT. It was determined that a long path with many curves would be conducive to good mixing.   Dimensions of the channel were chosen based on the resolution of the printer. Smaller channels should theoretically lead to better mixing, as the different liquids will be closer to each other, but the channels can’t get so small that the mold will be hard to print, or that they will be clogged when the PDMS is poured in. The channel dimensions shown in the instruction document were used as baselines to sanity check our design.   Vat photopolymerization was chosen for mold production due to its high resolution and precision, essential for the intricate channels and features of microfluidic devices. This method leverages a laser to cure photosensitive resin layer by layer, allowing for detailed and complex structures which are crucial in microfluidics. The primary limitation of this technique arises when using parylene as a coating material. Parylene, while providing a biocompatible and chemically resistant surface, can delaminate or poorly adhere to the resin surface due to the resin’s surface properties. This issue necessitates careful surface preparation to ensure adequate adhesion.   Instructions for how to go from the 3D printed mold to the final device.   Creation Instructions   1. Print &amp; Cure:   Break into the Digital Fabrication lab, or obtain access to a Form 3 SLA printer, then print.   Cleaning: Wash the printed mold in the Form Wash for 50 minutes, followed by a thorough rinse with isopropyl alcohol. Ensure a uniform sheen to confirm the removal of uncured resin.   Curing: Cure the mold with supports intact for 30 minutes at 60°C. Ensure no debris is on the mold before curing.   3. PDMS Casting:   Mix PDMS base and curing agent as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Pour the PDMS mixture into the mold and degas to remove air bubbles. Cure the PDMS in an oven at the recommended temperature and time.   4. Demolding and Preparation:   Carefully remove the PDMS cast from the mold. Trim any excess PDMS and ensure the surface that will bond to the glass slide is flat and clean.   5. Parylene Coating (Optional):   If there is any uncured resin, prepare the PDMS surface for coating and apply parylene using a specialized deposition system.   5. Parylene Coating (Not Optional This Time):   Now do it for real this time.   6. Plasma Bonding:   Treat both the PDMS device and the glass slide with plasma to activate the surfaces. Immediately after plasma treatment, align and bond the PDMS device to the glass slide, ensuring a tight and leak-free seal.   6b. Friendship Bonding:   Take a second to take a breath, be present, and make a new pal.   7. Final Inspection:   Inspect the bonded device for any leaks or defects. Test the device with dye mixing experiments to assess performance.

        "title": "Multi-Material Printable Pliers",
        "excerpt":"Project Overview   The goal of this project was to use multi-material 3D printing to create a pair of pliers that can be used right off the print bed. That is, pliers that are a single, print-in-place part. Print-in-place parts are parts that don’t require assembly, yet usually provide some functionality. This often takes the form of a multi-material print, or some print with small gaps that allow the part to move, like hinges or gears.   There are many great applications of print-in-place parts. That said, the best, and most historical, of course, is the classic ship in a bottle. Pioneered by Captain Edward Teach in the late 1550s, and printed originally using nothing but a bucket of chum and a sail-powered printer, ships in bottles quickly became one of the most awe-inspiring objects known to man. It was seen as particularly crazy by mainlanders, who were yet unaware of FFF printing. Nah I’m just kidding. It was the 1530s not the 1550s.   Really, print-in-place is great for anything that relies on mechanisms like hinges, gears, snap fits, etc. Further research shows some cool examples like a toothpaste squeezer and a really cute articulated sharks.   Multi-material print-in-place parts turn out most effectively for materials with similar physical properties. That said, they are usually more useful when the materials have some difference that allows the part to function in a specific way. For example, TPU is much more flexible than PLA, which makes it perfect as the spring of the pliers, but their physical properties are different enough that the connective tissue between materials needs to be designed a specific way to ensure they stay connected.   Iterations   This project only required only two iterations. Scale is unclear in the picture, but iteration 1 is about 50% bigger.              Version 1                  Version 2 (Final)        Fusion 360 Model     Design Details   The design is relatively straight-forward. It contains a TPU spring in the center, which is attached to four pieces of PLA: the two handles and the two claws.   The TPU is connected to the PLA via dove-tail connections to make sure the materials bond well. The PLA is offset a bit from the corners of the TPU square such that it can bend without them colliding. The TPU is 1.35mm thick, which was found to be a good width for optimal flexibility.   The PLA handles include a honeycomb pattern both to reduce print time and to look cool.   One downside of the design is that the claws of the pliers grab at a point rather than along a line/axis. This could easily be corrected, but was not worth doing during the span of the class project due to the timeline, other obligations, and others’ need to use the printer.   Specifications   The jaw length of the pliers is 30mm. The height is 11mm, and the depth is 7mm.   I am not sure the jaw capacity of the pliers. I tried to lift myself into the air with them while sitting on my chair, but I could not. Rats.   Print Settings   Print settings can be downloaded  here.  ","categories": [],
