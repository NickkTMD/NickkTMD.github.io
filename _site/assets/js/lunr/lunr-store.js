Fusion 360 Model     Operating the Pump      Setup: Securely attach the syringe into the holder, ensuring the tip is connected to the desired delivery tubing.   Power Up: Plug in the device to turn it on.   Flow Rate: Set the desired flow rate via knobs or program   Set Starting Position: Use the two side buttons to set the starting position.   Start: Once settings are configured, it’s time to ride. Press the ‘Start’ button.   Shutdown: In all likelihood the patient didn’t make it. Shut down to save power.                                                      Large Format 3D Printer Gallery       ","categories": [],
