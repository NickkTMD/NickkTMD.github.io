        "title": "Bike Phone Mount",
        "excerpt":"Purpose/Features of the Design   The Bike Phone Mount allows a user to mount their phone to their bike either horizontally or vertically. This is ideal for seeing directions, but can also be used for questionable leasure.   Top-Down Modeling   Top-down modeling is a CAD technique for designing assemblies with complex interdependencies and relationships between components. Components are designed and assembled at the same time, allowing dimensions from certain parts to be used when defining other parts. This also allows for global parameters to be created in a simplistic way.   Top Down modeling was leveraged in this design to ensure the various components fit together, and also to make sure the grip fit around the handlebar, and the case fit around a phone.   The large handlebar grip component was designed first. Dimensions for the grip were determined relative to a handlebar component in the same CAD assembly file. An opening for a screw was made in the large handlebar grip.   Next, the small handlebar grip component was made relative to the large one. This made it very easy to line everything up, such as the connecting axle and a concentric hole for a screw to connect the two.   Next, a slot was added for the large handlebar grip. The phone holder was then designed, such that it could slide into the previously created slot. Top down modeling allowed the slot and connector to be made relative to eachother such that they would fit together with proper clearance.   Last, a threaded rod on the phone case was added, and the nut that would screw into it to secure the phone was designed, again with the top down approach.   Rationale Behind the Design   Many choices were made when creating this design, all of them made perfectly and with perfect information.   The choice of using a locking mechanism and a heat-set insert to connect to the handlebar allowed for a good mix of simplicity and security in the connection. The connection to the handlebar is secure, works with different sizes, and is easily reversible.   The click-and-lock mechanism between the large and small handlebar grip components adds an extra layer of convenience, allowing users to quickly connect these parts without any tools or fasteners.   The sliding mechanism was the easiest way to allow for secure attaching of the phone either vertically or horizontally. The simple yet secure nature is evidence of an incredible design.   Finally, using a threaded rod and a hexagon nut proved to be the simplest way to lock the phone in place. Adjustment is easy, but in theory simple and secure.   Assembly Instructions   Assembling the phone holder is exceptionally straightforward:   Print the Components: 3D print the STL files for the phone holder components. Ensure that the printer settings match the chosen material (discussed later).   Assembly:  a. Melt a heat set insert into the large handlebar grip component.   b. Attach the small handle bar grip component to the larger one by clicking the axel into the round slot.   c. If desired, screw the small handle bar grip component into the larger one. It can also be locked into place using the phone holder.   d. Slide the phone holder into the handle bar grip component.   e. Place the phone in the holder and lock it into place using the hexagon nut.   Material Choice   PLA (Polylactic Acid) was chosen as the material for the phone holder case for several key reasons. PLA is first and foremost easy to print - its low printing temperature and minimal warping characteristics increase the odds of a smooth printing process.   Additionally, PLA is both durable and lightweight, which are critical attributes for a bike or scooter accessory. It can withstand outdoor conditions, including exposure to sunlight and moisture, without significant degradation.   PLA was chosen mainly over ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene). In comparison to ABS, PLA offers a few properties that make it a more attractive choice. PLA is known for its ease of printing, with a lower printing temperature and minimal warping. This increase in printability makes it more user-friendly to the millions that will print this case, especially for those new to 3D printing (not me). PLA is also better for the environemnt, which I definitely knew. While ABS can emit potentially harmful fumes during printing, PLA is non-toxic and odor-free, ensuring a safer and more comfortable working environment.   PLA is also biodegradable and derived from renewable resources, while ABS is not biodegradable and thus has a larger environmental footprint. Additionally, PLA’s lightweight yet durable nature strikes a balance between strength and minimal weight, ensuring the phone holder’s robustness without adding unnecessary mass to the bike or scooter.

        "title": "Electric Skateboard Truck & Deck",
        "excerpt":"Project Overview   The goal of this project was to construct the truck and deck for an electric skateboard. With enough electric skateboards, it was though that we would be able to make a generous donation to the Vanderbilt run club, with the goal of sunsetting that sad endeavor by 2044. The truck was designed using generative design in Fusion 360 and printed using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) in either Nylon 12 or aluminum alloy. The deck was designed to be printed in ABS using large filament 3d printing. All other parts were purchased.   Skateboard Truck   Fusion 360 Model   Aluminum    Nylon    Images             Render                                            I didn’t attach the generative design truck to the rest of the skateboard, mainly due to hubris and a soft spot in my heart that didn’t wish to make other students feel bad about their design, but this is what ChatGPT says it would look like:             This was taken in the Digital Fabrication lab        Discussion   The creation of the truck was a great opportunity to pair powder bed fusion and generative design. This pairing allows for rapid iteration of high fidelity parts, which is revolutionizing the way manufacturing is being approached, particularly in high-stakes industries like aerospace and automotive.   Overview   Powder bed fusion, a type of additive manufacturing, involves the use of a heat source (usually a laser, and electron beam, or a can of sunscreen and a lighter) to selectively melt and fuse material powder together. This technique allows for the creation of complex, high-strength, and lightweight parts. Generative design, on the other hand, is a design method that harnesses the power of computational algorithms to generate optimized structures and shapes based on specific constraints and requirements. In the case of Fusion360, geometries are modeled to either be preserved or kept clear, and required structural loads are specified. A design is the generated which meets the constraints. When combined, PBF and GD can create highly efficient and tailored components that were previously unimaginable.   Applications in Aerospace   In the aerospace industry, the weight of components is a critical factor. Every gram saved can significantly impact fuel efficiency and performance. The integration of PBF and GD in this sector allows for the creation of parts that are not only lighter but also stronger and more reliable. For instance, GD can be used to develop complex geometries that maximize strength while minimizing material use. These designs can then be realized through PBF, creating components that are impossible to produce using traditional manufacturing methods. This approach is particularly useful in designing parts like turbine blades, structural components of aircraft, and satellite components, where the combination of lightweight and high strength is paramount.   GD also often allows for assemblies to be simplified into single parts. This creates less points of failure in the part, and reduces the number of parts that need to be assembled. This is particularly useful in aerospace, where every part needs to be assembled in a clean room, and every part is a potential point of failure.   Ultimately, when designing parts optimally, generative design makes more conceptual sense than standard design. When creating a part, the designer is trying to map inputs to outputs within some constraints. Their design is an attempt to do this, however in most cases the optimal answer will be an abstract design that is only really possible to create via computation.   Automotive Industry Transformations   In the automotive industry, particularly in the realm of electric vehicles (EVs), the use of PBF and GD is equally transformative. The need for lighter, more efficient components is crucial in extending the range and performance of EVs. For example, GD can be employed to design lightweight yet robust chassis components or battery casings, which are then produced using PBF. This not only reduces the overall weight of the vehicle but also improves its efficiency and battery life. Furthermore, the ability to consolidate multiple parts into a single, complex component reduces assembly time and costs, a significant advantage in automotive manufacturing. Henry Ford was great and all, but now we’re trying to just do it right the first time.   Conclusion   The synergy between powder bed fusion and generative design is paving the way for innovative manufacturing solutions in industries where performance, efficiency, and precision are crucial. In aerospace, this pairing facilitates the creation of lighter, stronger components that contribute to fuel efficiency and safety. In the automotive sector, especially in the burgeoning field of electric vehicles, it enables the production of optimized parts that enhance vehicle performance and range. Educational projects like the electric longboard at Vanderbilt’s Wond’ry exemplify how these advanced technologies can be applied in practical settings, preparing the next generation of engineers and designers for the future of manufacturing.   Longboard Deck   Fusion 360 Model    Simulation Results             Displacement                  Safety Factor        Design Description   Crafted through the cutting-edge capabilities of Fusion360’s simulation tools, the longboard deck is a marvel of modern engineering and design. Starting with a carefully selected SVG, the deck’s initial shape was born from precise scaling and extrusion, setting the stage for its distinctive silhouette. This digital inception was only the beginning of a meticulous process of creation, where each iteration brought with it a refinement of the deck’s architecture.   With each cycle, the thickness and cutouts underwent a series of adjustments, driven by a rigorous application of simulation tools that scrutinized every aspect of the deck’s durability and resilience. The goal was unwavering: to engineer a deck robust enough to support a 200-pound rider with absolute integrity. The simulations, intricate digital trials that tested the bounds of physics, were relentless, each one inching the design closer to its final form.   The result of these iterations was not just a deck, but a testament to the harmony of form and function. The safety factor, a quantifiable measure of the deck’s ability to withstand stress, was pushed beyond the threshold of 1.0, ensuring a robust platform for riders. The culmination of this iterative design was a deck characterized by its strength and an impressive resistance to deformation, capping at a maximum of 6mm displacement even under the concentrated weight of a rider.   The final design of the deck emerged as a symphony of strength and flexibility, its contours and cutouts finalized not just for aesthetic appeal but for their contribution to the structural integrity of the board. This balance of form, function, and beauty marks the deck as a paragon of longboard engineering, ready to carve the streets with precision and grace, and to endure the trials of ride after ride.   Scale Model Printed   I tried to print a scale model. Scaled it up 10x but it just started printing a block filling the entirety of the 3D printer. Just kidding, I’m just a washed up senior please don’t fail me.   Instructions  Be sure to add three 0’s to all Gcode commands to account for the much larger volume of the large filament printer.

        "title": "Microfluidic Mixer",
        "excerpt":"Project Overview   The goal of this project was to construct a homogenous mixer microfluidic device to mix two unknown liquids. I kept asking Professor Florian why he needed so many devices to mix so many fluids, and what the fluids were, but he would just shoot me a stern look then continue on. I think he was trying to put lazy old laminar flow in its place.   Some applications of a homogenous microfluidic mixer include:     Mixing of reagents for chemical reactions   Mixing of blood samples for analysis   Mixing of fluids for drug delivery   Lab on a chip devices (think Elizabeth Holmes, we stan a queen)   Design   The project was designed based on this paper:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116190/pdf/ijms-12-03263.pdf as well as research through ChatGPT. It was determined that a long path with many curves would be conducive to good mixing.   Dimensions of the channel were chosen based on the resolution of the printer. Smaller channels should theoretically lead to better mixing, as the different liquids will be closer to each other, but the channels can’t get so small that the mold will be hard to print, or that they will be clogged when the PDMS is poured in. The channel dimensions shown in the instruction document were used as baselines to sanity check our design.   Vat photopolymerization was chosen for mold production due to its high resolution and precision, essential for the intricate channels and features of microfluidic devices. This method leverages a laser to cure photosensitive resin layer by layer, allowing for detailed and complex structures which are crucial in microfluidics. The primary limitation of this technique arises when using parylene as a coating material. Parylene, while providing a biocompatible and chemically resistant surface, can delaminate or poorly adhere to the resin surface due to the resin’s surface properties. This issue necessitates careful surface preparation to ensure adequate adhesion.   Instructions for how to go from the 3D printed mold to the final device.   Creation Instructions   1. Print &amp; Cure:   Break into the Digital Fabrication lab, or obtain access to a Form 3 SLA printer, then print.   Cleaning: Wash the printed mold in the Form Wash for 50 minutes, followed by a thorough rinse with isopropyl alcohol. Ensure a uniform sheen to confirm the removal of uncured resin.   Curing: Cure the mold with supports intact for 30 minutes at 60°C. Ensure no debris is on the mold before curing.   3. PDMS Casting:   Mix PDMS base and curing agent as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Pour the PDMS mixture into the mold and degas to remove air bubbles. Cure the PDMS in an oven at the recommended temperature and time.   4. Demolding and Preparation:   Carefully remove the PDMS cast from the mold. Trim any excess PDMS and ensure the surface that will bond to the glass slide is flat and clean.   5. Parylene Coating (Optional):   If there is any uncured resin, prepare the PDMS surface for coating and apply parylene using a specialized deposition system.   5. Parylene Coating (Not Optional This Time):   Now do it for real this time.   6. Plasma Bonding:   Treat both the PDMS device and the glass slide with plasma to activate the surfaces. Immediately after plasma treatment, align and bond the PDMS device to the glass slide, ensuring a tight and leak-free seal.   6b. Friendship Bonding:   Take a second to take a breath, be present, and make a new pal.   7. Final Inspection:   Inspect the bonded device for any leaks or defects. Test the device with dye mixing experiments to assess performance.

        "title": "Multi-Material Printable Pliers",
        "excerpt":"Project Overview   The goal of this project was to use multi-material 3D printing to create a pair of pliers that can be used right off the print bed. That is, pliers that are a single, print-in-place part. Print-in-place parts are parts that don’t require assembly, yet usually provide some functionality. This often takes the form of a multi-material print, or some print with small gaps that allow the part to move, like hinges or gears.   There are many great applications of print-in-place parts. That said, the best, and most historical, of course, is the classic ship in a bottle. Pioneered by Captain Edward Teach in the late 1550s, and printed originally using nothing but a bucket of chum and a sail-powered printer, ships in bottles quickly became one of the most awe-inspiring objects known to man. It was seen as particularly crazy by mainlanders, who were yet unaware of FFF printing. Nah I’m just kidding. It was the 1530s not the 1550s.   Really, print-in-place is great for anything that relies on mechanisms like hinges, gears, snap fits, etc. Further research shows some cool examples like a toothpaste squeezer and a really cute articulated sharks.   Multi-material print-in-place parts turn out most effectively for materials with similar physical properties. That said, they are usually more useful when the materials have some difference that allows the part to function in a specific way. For example, TPU is much more flexible than PLA, which makes it perfect as the spring of the pliers, but their physical properties are different enough that the connective tissue between materials needs to be designed a specific way to ensure they stay connected.   Iterations   This project only required only two iterations. Scale is unclear in the picture, but iteration 1 is about 50% bigger.              Version 1                  Version 2 (Final)        Fusion 360 Model     Design Details   The design is relatively straight-forward. It contains a TPU spring in the center, which is attached to four pieces of PLA: the two handles and the two claws.   The TPU is connected to the PLA via dove-tail connections to make sure the materials bond well. The PLA is offset a bit from the corners of the TPU square such that it can bend without them colliding. The TPU is 1.35mm thick, which was found to be a good width for optimal flexibility.   The PLA handles include a honeycomb pattern both to reduce print time and to look cool.   One downside of the design is that the claws of the pliers grab at a point rather than along a line/axis. This could easily be corrected, but was not worth doing during the span of the class project due to the timeline, other obligations, and others’ need to use the printer.   Specifications   The jaw length of the pliers is 30mm. The height is 11mm, and the depth is 7mm.   I am not sure the jaw capacity of the pliers. I tried to lift myself into the air with them while sitting on my chair, but I could not. Rats.   Print Settings   Print settings can be downloaded  here.  ","categories": [],
