## Operating the Pump

1. **Setup:** Securely attach the syringe into the holder, ensuring the tip is connected to the desired delivery tubing.
2. **Power Up:** Plug in the device to turn it on.
3. **Flow Rate:** Set the desired flow rate via knobs or program
4. **Set Starting Position:** Use the two side buttons to set the starting position.
5. **Start:** Once settings are configured, it's time to ride. Press the 'Start' button.
6. **Shutdown:** In all likelihood the patient didn't make it. Shut down to save power.
